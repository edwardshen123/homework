Machine.java
What is Sprices? : Line 9
Have comments for abreviated variables : Line 10 & 11

For Machine.java, overall the structure and content of the code is easily readable
and understandable. There are only minor faults with the code. First, there are
special terms which the coder put in without placing a comment that defines the name.
Second there are abreviated variables that isn't un-abreviated in the comments.
However, other than those problems, the code is great.
